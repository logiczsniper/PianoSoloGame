## Piano Solo

##### Introduction
The space between a Z and M key is the exact number of white keys in one piano octave.
In other words, you can perfectly fit one octave of a piano into a keyboard. Naturally, I had to
make a virtual piano game with one octave; here it is. Imagine Guitar Hero, for piano, but only one
octave, and just in general a bit worse: introducing Piano Solo! <br>
The user selects one of 5 songs that range in difficulty from EASY-MEDIUM-HARD. Once the play button
is hit, the selected song has it's notes fall from the top of the newly generated screen. The remaining
lives are displayed in their own window. If the key falls past a certain range without being hit, a heart
disappears. On easy difficulty, the notes travel slowly and you have max lives to start. On medium you have
less lives and the notes travel faster, and on hard it is even more so.

##### The Keys
So each key on the keyboard corresponds to a key on the 'piano'. Here is a little diagram to show- <br>
An actual piano octave:

     |C#|D#|  |F#|G#|A#|
	|C||D||E||F||G||A||B|

The equivalent keys on the keyboard:

     |S#|D#|  |G#|H#|J#|
	|Z||X||C||V||B||N||M|
